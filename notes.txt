In our simulation:

Traffic direction: STAs → APs (uplink)
    why? easier to work with unidirectional half duplex simulations

Who's transmitting: The STAs (clients)


how are we implementing traffic scenarios at the moment?
set dataRates for each AP, light, heavy, medium, will implement bursty traffic (even time varying) in later phases.

independent, per AP control implemented in the latest version of the project. initially global CWmin and delta actions were in place.
